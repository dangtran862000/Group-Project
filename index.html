I have been living and studying in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City for 20 years. Currently, I am a second-year student with my first semester in major that is a bachelor of information technology at RMIT Vietnam University. For me, the field of science and technology, especially information technology, has brought me the passion to learn new knowledge by the vastness of the IT world. I first encountered programming in grade 8, when it was the pascal programming language as an official subject in the school curriculum. I was intrigued by the command lines and the magic of computer algorithms. Since then, I have decided to enter the computer science class at high school and have achieved the silver medal for good students in IT. Besides, not only interested in technology but also music for example playing instruments and participating in volunteer activities are my hobbies. I hope that the time I spend studying and researching information technology will help me improve my professional knowledge and hands-on experience in the technology industry.</p>

I come from Vinh Long City, after graduating from Nguyen Binh Khiem High School, I am now studying at RMIT University. Previously, I was a student specializing in Chemistry. Instead of choosing to become a doctor or pharmacist, I followed my passion and became a member of SST (School of Science and Technology). I have a great curiosity to explore the Data Industry, and I expect to be a Data Scientist. Our team name is called '4tech', which stands for 'Four for Technology.'

I am Vietnamese, born in Ho Chi Minh city and I’ve spent three years studying abroad in Sydney, Australia and graduated high school there. My hobbies are playing an instrument (piano and guitar), listening to music, and playing games. I like playing games and I’m curious about how they operate behind the scenes. I also like to sit on my computer doing research, so I think doing IT is suitable for me. I’ve had the basic knowledge about coding in Python 3.0+ as it was a part of the study program that I took part in.</p>

Currently, in 2020, I am studying Information Technology program at RMIT with specialising in web development because I want to be a full-stack developer and mobile developer. In the past, I used to have a strong passion for football and swimming because I can connect closer to my friends and I can train myself. I have won a championship in a competition in high school. I have to admit that it is the best experience and exciting during my high school lifetime. However, my passion for IT became large when I saw my big brother, a competitive programmer, solving many challenging database problems such as arrays, multidimensional arrays and matrices in an online contest every weekend. Then, I follow his path to solving problems on the Leetcode website and join a contest at the weekends.</p>

I am a practical and appropriate person to solve difficult group problems in a flexible way instead of working with boring theory. Besides, with good observation and ability to communicate I will be one of the connections that help the team can work together comfortably. Also, as a result of my personality test and Myers-Briggs, I always have a positive and responsible energy in my assigned work.

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>In general, IT staff play an important role in monitoring and maintaining the operation of computers and networks of an organization or enterprise. In the era of technology 4.0, the emergence of new technologies in everyday work requires someone to install, diagnose software and hardware failures, and resolve these technical problems.</p>
        <p>The work is as well as general knowledge about how computer systems are used and applying technical understanding relevant to computer software or hardware. For other IT students, their ideal job is usually an application developer, a website developer or one of the other specific IT fields. But for me this is considered an ideal job because it gives me an overview of a big picture of the world of technology instead of just focusing on a specific field.</p>
        <p>After consulting the Burning Glass data, I decided I would not change this ideal job because of the opportunities that this job offers me. This work provides a dynamic, comfortable and professional working environment with no sitting at the desk all day. It opens up many possibilities for developing my skills, building relationships, updating new technologies, not just software and hardware, and training my English skills.</p>
        <p>In short, this job will not bring a significant income and is not the dream job of many people. However,  IT officers are an indispensable part of any business, who helps to bring about the smooth and balanced working of a computer system. Besides, this job creates a great career opportunity in the era of industrialization and modernization today.</p>

        <dl>
        <dt>After consulting the information provided by Burning Glass Data, I still have not changed the viewpoint of my ideal Job. The following are additional analyzes for the above statement:</dt><br>
        <dd>- The Specialised Skills listed Python with the low employers' demand and without the existence of the R programming language. However, according to the information provided by the Online data science community Kaggle's annual survey, “ Python is utilized by 76.3% of respondents and R by 59.2%” . [1]. So Python and R still play a crucial role in the Data area.</dd><br>
        <dd>- Presentation skills, as well as Analytical skills, support Data scientists to demonstrate their results with other teams and customers who cannot 'read' the statistic.</dd><br>
        <dt>Although the Data Science Job was not listed as a high demand job in the Burning Burning Glass Data 2018, I  still love to do this job because of my passion for data, and I believe in the future with rapid development, the demand for employers to data also increases.</dt>

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>After looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. In my views, a Software Engineer is the one who has the ability to create new advanced, innovative products to help the community in various fields of life. This job required to have a high determination and a mindset of not giving up which I have as being a Software Engineer is considered to be one of the most stressful jobs. For me, being a Software Engineer is one dream I want to have come true in the future.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, at this time of life where it is called the 4.0 ages, the age of technology, this is the time when the people want the most advanced and innovative technologies for their life. That becomes a big chance for developers to have their creativity to actually act and create products that can supply the needs for users and this is the time where different companies are trying to recruit the qualified employees to be a part of their families. Nowadays, thanks to the innovating of programming languages, they have come up with an easy high-level programming language called Python, which can be approachable by everyone at the biggest operating system (Microsoft Windows and MacOS). According to different surveys on coders of all ages, Python is easy to learn, and it can be really efficient as there are many different sources and libraries for users to work on their project. Even though in the Burning Glass data, Python is not one of the top biggest languages, these results were in March 2018 and now is August 2020, which means more than 2 years already and it is way different now.</p>
        <p>Besides that, Software Engineers are the ones who bring needs in different areas of life into their products (medical, entertainment, etc.). Without these people, it is a big loss to a company when it comes to competing in this time era. </p>

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>Obviously no, there is an enormous demand for constructing and developing websites to meet human's desires. Currently, around 1.8 billion websites are created with approximately 400 million active. </p>
        <p>Although the job titles for web developers are around 381 in Australia in 2018, the number of websites are growing very fast. To be clear, it is not very reliable to use outdated-data to compare with the current jobs. There are so many web applications we use nowadays such as Facebook, Youtube, etc. Note that, for people who use computers, they preferably use a web-based platform, which is convenient to open multiple websites for doing their work and easier for searching for their likes. Therefore, seeing fewer jobs for a web developer in a country is not right as a whole.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, the decentralized web will be the next era of web development, in which user's data will be owned by themselves and not collected by the organisation or company. Thus, jobs for a web developer will be in high demand.</p>

    <br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">I teach computing although my background is quite complicated because I was not originally an IT professional. I came into computing as my first degree was in psychology. When I was studying for my degree, in the 1980s, microcomputers were starting to be used more commonly. A lot of psychology about doing mathematical tests of significance. For example, when you experiment with making a decision about whether the results are due to chance or actually unlikely to be significant. As a result, I did a lot of programming of those mathematical tests and that's how I actually started being interested in computing and also being realizing that the way you present information in the system is really importantr</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">As a lecturer, I started working in computing in 1992, that was when I did my PhD. Again, when i started working on my PhD, I worked in the university that used mackintoshes. I was very interested in graphic user interfaces and the way they present information, so my PhD was about different styles of user interface. Later, I went to work in the university in the UK because the curriculum included a topic area called human computer interaction, which is cognitive ergonomics. This was the area I was building courses about human computer interaction in the early 90s, which is still my core subject. After that, I became interested in another area called computer forensics, which is a very related area because it's about how people use computers when they are engaging in criminal activity.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">I did actually work in the period of time in the civil service department called the land registry. During the period that I was working there, most of the work I did was actually manual. We had large rooms full of filing cabinets, full of paper records but whilst I was there they were starting to change that information to computer-based records. Every piece of land you have to have a list of the legal constraints on that land, the proprietor of the land. You need to have a map of exactly the location of the land, so you can identify it. There are lots of different kinds of media present within each of those records for each piece of land and what priority of work you have to do.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">Work primarily in University, so mostly teachers/lecturers and students. Requires not just passing ideas but also need to have two way interactions. Besides that, interactions with different types of computers’ systems.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>5. Please tell us about your interaction with other IT professionals?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">As a lecturer I mostly work with other lecturers inside and outside my university. Usually we would talk about new projects/ideas that we find fascinating and we would discuss about the new topics and different ways to educate our students.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>6. What about your interaction with clients or investors? </i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">As I’m a lecturer so I would consider my students to be my clients that I mostly work with. I would judge my success based on their levels of achieving the knowledge that I shared with them and how they apply those to their life in the future. </p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>7.  What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">I spend a lot of time interacting with students to comprehend if they understand the lecture if they have any difficulties. Besides, I'm researching new technologies to modernize the lecture. Because lesson programs always have to be updated according to contemporary times, lectures must also be renewed to keep up.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>8. Which aspects of your work do you spend most of your time on and find most challenging?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">Teaching about the subject is challenging as new exciting and new things keep being introduced as time goes on, so it is challenging to adapt to those and transfer it the easiest way to students. In addition to the challenge of updating much new knowledge, I also have to try to develop my lecture adequately and more clearly to understand. Use simple words to describe broad and moderately confusing topics for beginners.</p><br>
    <h6 class="w3-opacity w3-justify "><i>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</i></h6>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-justify ">Everything is the same except that the focus of the environment keeps shifting and keeps changing throughout the time. For example, I learn new applications produced to work to supply the original center of the situation. Besides, I also update the information by going to many different companies and working conditions to observe how they handle the times' innovation.</p>

    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Information technology is rapidly changing that both neophytes and professionals must keep learning and practising in order not to be eliminated and outdated with advanced technology. However, beginners may find it struggling to choose whether software, programming languages, skills are suitable for them and later in their career options. This website can help newcomers have an overview type of IT major, from required skills to the prospect of demandable jobs in the future and teach you how to obtain necessary skills. For instance, what a full-stack engineer would do, what is data science, how different between a software architect and a solution architect, etc. Also, our website can guide you to discriminate between the advantages and the disadvantages of the major you follow.</h5>

    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The target of this project is to orient introductory students in the information technology field to learn the basics of programming, including two main languages, which are Python and HTML. Our team hopes to finish the project by creating a temporary website platform that is closest to complete with user-friendly and easy-to-use features. In addition, with all four members of the 4-TECH group being students of information technology, we understand the difficulty of approaching new ideas for the first time. 4-TECH brings this project with the desire to create a learning forum, sharing knowledge from seniors with the aim of promoting a passion for a programming subject. In the first phase of the project, our team will achieve a demo with the least amount of bugs within its limits and bring a positive effect and also a meaningful gift from 4-Tech for new students when the project is completed.</h5><br><br>
